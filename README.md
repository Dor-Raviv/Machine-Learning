# Machine-Learning
This repository is my first public repositories I want to share. 

I will try to upload one project a week. Many of the projects are based on Interests I have & wish to share with everyone.

I will also try to explain & elaborate on my work here for educational purposes.

# Data Visualisation

using t-SNE & sklearn to visualize into 2 dimensions a data set with 70 features. The data set is a monitored body during an exercise.
t-SNE is an algirithm based on Laurens van der Maaten work. (https://lvdmaaten.github.io/software/)

It is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data into a space of two or three dimensions, which can then be visualized in a scatter plot. Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points.
